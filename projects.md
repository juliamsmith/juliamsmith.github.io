# Grasshopper thermal physiology (University of Washington -- Seattle, graduate school)

I aim to make an energy budget for my study species to assess the hypothesis that temporal activity partitioning, microhabitat selection, and differing thermal optima for digestion and locomotion improve energy balances. Ultimately I want to estimate energetic shifts due to climate change.

The team: too many to list, but members of the labs of Lauren Buckley, Sean Schoville, and Caroline Williams, the broader project led by postdoc Monica Scheffer, and with invaluable help and experience from César Nufio

# Plant coexistence (Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, summer internship 2020)

We studied native species that could potentially be used for restoration in a riparian buffer zone and how their growth and interactions were affected by soil nitrogen level. We conducted these experiments in our backyards due to the pandemic.

# Bowerbird agent-based model (University of Chicago, undergrad)

Bowerbirds (Ptilonorhynchidae) reside in Australia and New Guinea, and the males build complex structures, known as bowers, for the sole purpose of attracting females. Bowerbirds are unique among birds in that the males have an _externalized_ secondary sexual characteristic (as opposed to plumage, song, or display), which is necessary for mating success. As a result, male bowerbirds often destroy the bowers of rivals to increase their own mating success. However, a male’s decision to spend time away from his own bower can be costly, as he may miss opportunities to mate or defend his bower. In their 1994 paper, Stephen and Melinda Pruett-Jones used an algebraic model to demonstrate that a marauding strategy is superior to guarding, assuming a male interacts only with his nearest neighbor. We extended this two-bird game to a more realistic scenario in which multiple males interact. To do this we made a continuous-time agent-based model representing the males' activities during a mating season. We explored how the relative success of marauding and guarding strategies is impacted by the geographic dispersion of bowers, the proportion of marauders in a population, and bower repair time. We later also extended the model to allow males to change their strategy and/or bower position from season to season (inspired by "win stay, lose shift" in game theory).
