I am a PhD candidate in Biology at UW Seattle in the Buckley lab. I am interested in integrating quantitative and empirical methods to understand the ecological impacts of climate change. In the Buckley lab, I study grasshopper thermoregulatory behavior and energetics. The next step is to model how climate change may have affected behavior, energetics, and ultimately fitness over the past 70 years. I am also passionate about education (especially teaching quantitative methods in biology) and hope to get more involved in education research soon!
